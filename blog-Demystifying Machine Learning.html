                            <h4>Tradition vs. Transformation: A Look Back and Forward</h4>
                            <p>Traditionally, computers used to follow an explicit set of instructions. For instance, if
                                you wanted the computer to perform a simple task of adding two numbers, you had to spell
                                out every step. However, as our data became more complex, this manual approach of giving
                                instructions for each situation became inadequate.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>This is where Machine Learning emerged as a game changer. We wanted computers to learn
                                from examples just like we learn from our experiences. Imagine teaching a child how to
                                ride a bicycle by showing it a few times and then letting him fall, figure it out, and
                                learn on his own. That's the idea behind Machine Learning. This innovation has not only
                                transformed industries but has become an indispensable necessity in today's world.</p>
                            <h4>Learning the Basics</h4>
                            <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of the term <strong>&rdquo;Machine
                                    learning&ldquo;</strong>, let us familiarize ourselves with some fundamental terms:
                            </p>
                            <h4>Data</h4>
                            <p>Data is the lifeblood of Machine learning. It refers to the information that a computer
                                uses to learn. This information can be numbers, pictures, or anything else that a
                                computer can understand. This is further divided into 2 categories:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> This data refers to the examples that we use to
                                    teach the computer.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li><strong>Testing Data:</strong> After learning, we test the performance of the
                                    computer using some new, unseen data referred to as the test data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Label and Features</h4>
                            <p>Imagine that you are teaching a kid how to differentiate between different animals. The
                                name of the animals (dog, cat, etc) would be the labels while the characteristics of
                                these animals (number of legs, fur, etc) that help you recognize them are the
                                features.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>Models</h4>
                            <p>It is the outcome of the Machine Learning process. It is the mathematical representation
                                of the patterns and relationships within the data. It's like making a map after
                                exploring a new place.</p>
                            <h4>Types of Machine Learning</h4>
                            <p>There are four main types of Machine Learning:</p>
                            <h4>Supervised Machine Learning</h4>
                            <p>It is also referred to as guided learning. We provide the labeled dataset to our Machine
                                Learning algorithm where the correct output is already known. Based on these examples it
                                learns the hidden patterns in the data and can predict or correctly classify the new
                                data. The common categories within supervised learning are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Classification</strong>: Sorting things into separate distinct categories
                                    for example classifying pictures as cats or dogs, emails as spam or not spam, etc.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Regression:</strong> It involves predicting numerical values for example
                                    price of the house, your GPA, or the number of sales based on certain features.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h4>
                            <p>Here the computer is provided the unlabelled data without prior hints and it explores the
                                hidden patterns on its own. Just consider that you are handed a box of puzzle pieces
                                with no picture and your task is to group similar pictures to form a complete picture.
                                Clustering is the most common type of unsupervised learning where similar data points
                                are grouped into a group. For example, we can employ clustering to group similar kinds
                                of social media posts and users can follow the sub-topics of their interest.</p>
                            <h4>Semi-Supervised Machine Learning</h4>
                            <p>Semi-supervised learning contains a mix of labeled and unlabelled datasets where the
                                labeled dataset acts as the guiding point in identifying the patterns in data. For
                                example, you give a chef a list of the main ingredients to use but do not provide the
                                complete recipe. So although they don&rsquo;t have the recipe some hints that might help
                                them to get started.</p>
                            <h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>
                            <p>Reinforcement learning is also called learning by doing. It interacts with the
                                environment and gets a reward as a penalty for its actions. With time, it learns to
                                maximize the reward and perform well. Imagine that you are training a puppy and you give
                                positive feedback by rewarding him when he behaves well and negative feedback in the
                                form of withholding rewards. Over time, the puppy learns the actions that lead to
                                rewards and also the ones that don&rsquo;t</p>
                            <h4>High-Level Machine Learning Process</h4>
                            <p>Machine Learning, much like the art of cooking, possesses the magical ability to
                                transform raw, disparate elements into profound insights. Just as a skilled chef adeptly
                                combines various ingredients to craft a delicious dish. These are the 6 basic steps used
                                to perform a Machine Learning Task:</p>
                            <center><img

                                    data-ll-status="loaded" /><br /> Image by Author</center>
                            <h4>1. Data Collection</h4>
                            <p>Data is an important resource and its quality matters a lot. Diverse, more relevant data
                                yields better results. You can think of it as the Chef gathering various ingredients
                                from different markets.</p>
                            <h4>2. Data Preprocessing</h4>
                            <p>Most of our data is not in the desired form. Like washing, chopping, and preparing
                                ingredients before cooking, data preprocessing involves cleaning and organizing data for
                                the learning process. Some common issues that you might face are missing data, outliers,
                                incorrect format, etc.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h4>3. Choosing an Algorithm</h4>
                            <p>Similar to selecting the recipe for a specific dish, you choose an algorithm based on the
                                problem that you are trying to solve. This choice may also be influenced by the type of
                                data that you have.</p>
                            <h4>4. Training the Model</h4>
                            <p>Think of it as the cooking process where we wait unless the flavors come together.
                                Similarly, we let the model learn from the training data. An important concept of
                                learning rate also comes into play here that determines how big of a step your model
                                takes during each iteration of training. If you add too much salt or spice at once, the
                                dish could become overpowering. Conversely, if you add too little, the flavors might not
                                develop fully. The learning rate finds the perfect balance for gradual flavor
                                enhancement.</p>
                            <h4>5. Testing &amp; Evaluation</h4>
                            <p>Once the learning process wraps up, we put it to the test using special test data, much
                                like tasting a dish and examining its appearance before sharing it with others. Common
                                evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, depending on the
                                problem at hand.</p>
                            <h4>6. Tuning and Iteration</h4>
                            <p>Adjusting the seasoning or ingredients to perfect the dish, you fine-tune your models by
                                introducing more variables, choosing a different learning algorithm, and adjusting
                                parameters or the learning rate.</p>
