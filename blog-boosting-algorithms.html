<blockquote>Machine learning with boosting algorithms is becoming increasingly important to fight phishing emails. Researchers are improving these algorithms by using better features, fine-tuning parameters, combining models, and leveraging deep learning techniques like transfer learning. This will help machine learning better protect users from evolving phishing attacks.</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30">Phishing is a major online danger that includes deceiving people
                                        through false emails to steal sensitive information like passwords and financial
                                        data. As attackers become more sophisticated, the role of machine learning in
                                        identifying phishing emails before they land in users' inboxes is growing in
                                        importance.<br><br>
                                        Boosting techniques are frequently used in the field of machine learning to
                                        detect phishing attacks. Combining several "weaker" classifiers in order to
                                        enhance the performance of a classifier. AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and
                                        XGBoost are widely used boosting techniques for identifying phishing attacks.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Although boosting algorithms have been successful in identifying phishing
                                        attempts, there is room for improving their efficiency even more. Listed below
                                        are various approaches that researchers have explored to improve boosting
                                        algorithms for better detection of phishing emails.

                                        Methods for generating additional input features to improve machine learning
                                        algorithms.
                                        Data such as word frequency, character types, and details of URLs/attachments in
                                        emails are crucial inputs for every machine learning model. Carefully selecting
                                        advantageous attributes through feature engineering can greatly improve results.

                                        Adjusting parameters to optimise performance to its maximum level.
                                        Boosting algorithms are equipped with various hyperparameters that control
                                        elements like learning rate, number of trees/iterations, maximum tree depth, and
                                        minimum sample split. Improving the hyperparameters with grid search or Bayesian
                                        optimisation can boost the boosting algorithms' capability to learn better from
                                        the training data.

                                        Methods in which various models are merged to enhance overall effectiveness.
                                        Utilising techniques like stacking has shown promise with different boosting
                                        models. Every model focuses on different aspects of the problem, and combining
                                        them maximises their combined strengths. This enhances the overall detection
                                        rates beyond what single models accomplish.

                                        Deep learning techniques like transfer learning can be used to enhance the
                                        performance of boosting algorithms. Transfer learning is a method that allows
                                        models trained on a large amount of general domain text to be adjusted for the
                                        task of detecting phishing. This effectively enhances the model's comprehension of
                                        phishing emails by equipping it with a wider range of language knowledge.

                                        their effectiveness can be enhanced to a greater extent. This enables machine
